## Clause

A clause is a group of words that has a **subject** and a **predicate**.

> The subject of the sentence is what (or whom) the sentence is about. It is often either a noun or a pronoun.
> A predicate is the part of a sentence, or a clause, that tells what the subject is doing or what the subject is.
>

- Main clause or independent clause - Clause that makes sense by itself.
- Subordinate clause or dependent clause - clause that would not make sense(or incomplete) independently.

> A dependent clause usually begins with a subordinating conjunction, a relative pronoun, or some other word that causes it to become dependent. A dependent clause will make sense only when attached to an independent clause.
> Dependent clauses can come after, before, or in the middle of the independent clause.
