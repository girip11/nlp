A clause is a group of words that has a **subject** and a **predicate**.

> The subject of the sentence is what (or whom) the sentence is about. It is often either a noun or a pronoun.
> A predicate is the part of a sentence, or a clause, that tells what the subject is doing or what the subject is.
>

- Main clause or independent clause - Clause that makes sense by itself.
- Subordinate clause or dependent clause - clause that would not make sense(or incomplete) independently.

> A dependent clause usually begins with a subordinating conjunction, a relative pronoun, or some other word that causes it to become dependent. A dependent clause will make sense only when attached to an independent clause.
> Dependent clauses can come after, before, or in the middle of the independent clause.

- `Michael bought a new computer, but he still has the old one. [Two independent clauses` - Two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction.
- `Although(subordinating conjunction) he still has his old one, Michael now has a new computer.`(first one is dependent and second one is independent)

**NOTE**- Coordinating conjunction does not count as part of the clause, while the subordinating conjunction counts as part of the clause.
