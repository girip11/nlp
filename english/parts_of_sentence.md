# Parts of a sentence

## Subject

Subject - Person or the thing the sentence is about. Subject need not always occur at the start of the sentence.

In the sentence, `Our real enemy is corruption` - `corruption` is the subject.

## Verb

- Action that is done by the subject

## Predicate

- part of the sentence which tell something about the subject.

## Object

Subject being the doer, subject does something to an object. Objects can either be [direct object or indirect object](./direct_indirect_objects.md).

- In sentences with indirect object, we will also have a direct object.

## Complement

- word or phrase or a clause that is **necessary** to complete the meaning of the sentence.

Ex: `I am a teacher` - `a teacher` is a complement.

- Complement adds more information about the subject(subject complement) or the object(object complement) of the sentence.

Subject complement examples

- `The baby is cute` - `cute` adds more information on the subject.
- `You look happy` - `happy` describes the mood of the subject.
  Object complement examples

**NOTE**: Subject complement always follows a [linking verb](./gerunds.md), while object follows an action verb.

Object complement

- `I ate a pizza(object) that was cheesy(object complement)`

More Examples

- `We gave Ram(indirect obj) the captaincy(direct obj)`
- `We made Ram(direct obj) Captain(object complement)` - Another way to remember is here `captain` refers to `Ram`. So its an object complement.

## Adjunct

- Adjunct is a part of a sentence that contains extra information, **that's not necessary** to complete the meaning of a sentence.

Ex - `We gifted Ram a pen <adjunct>on his birthday</adjunct>`
