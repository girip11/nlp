# Gerunds

In english language, gerunds are verbs that function as noun.

Ex: "Do you mind my borrowing these supplies?" Here borrowing is a gerund.

One way to spot a gerund is to notice that they always end in `-ing`, but at the same time we should also be able to distinguish such words with actual verbs in their continous(past/present) form.

Ex: `I was sitting there` - Here `sitting` is a **verb**(not a gerund) in the past continuous form.

> Gerunds can function as subjects, direct objects, indirect objects, objects of prepositions, and predicate nouns.

## Predicate nouns

- A predicate noun(predicate nominative) is a noun or noun phrase connected to the subject of a sentence through a linking verb.

**NOTE**: Predicate nouns can only follow the linking verb and not an action verb. Nouns that follow action verbs are either direct or indirect objects.

Linking verb connects the subject to additional information. It could convey one of the following

- relationship between subject and the sentence complement.
- connects the subject with words that identify or describe the subject(predicate adjective)
- identify a relationship (with a predicate noun)
